        <h1> ABOUT US 
        </h1>
        <p> The Rekhi Centre of Excellence for the Science of Happiness was established at Indian Institute of Technology(IIT) Kharagpur, in collaboration with the Rekhi Foundation for Happiness. Inspired by the vision of Dr. Satinder Singh Rekhi and Mrs. Harpreet rekhi in 2016, the Centre was founded with the belief that emotional well-being and inner happiness are as vital as technical and academic excellence in the life of an engineer.

The initiative is part of a larger national movement led by the Rekhi Foundation to bring the science of happiness into higher education institutions across India. SGSITS proudly became a part of this movement in 2025, becoming one of the first technical institutions in Madhya Pradesh to formally adopt this transformative concept.

Since its inception, the Centre has conducted workshops, talks, experiential sessions, and mindfulness activities to promote emotional resilience and mental well-being among students and faculty</p>
